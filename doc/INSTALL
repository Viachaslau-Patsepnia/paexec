                             INSTALLATION

0)
   Maybe paexec has been already packaged for your platform. See PACKAGES
   section below and your system package management tools.

1)
   We need bmake (portable version of NetBSD make) for building paexec.
   I'd recommend to use latest stable version.

   http://crufty.net/help/sjg/bmake.html
   http://freshmeat.net/projects/bmake/

   NOTE:    !!! GNU make IS NOT GOOD !!!

2)
   We also need mk-configure >= 0.20.0.

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/mk-configure/

3)
   "libmaa" library is also needed. It is a part of
   "dict" project available here:

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/dict/

4)
   If you want to change the default build options,
   run mkcmake like this

     env [YOUR_ASSIGNMENTS] mkcmake <target> [YOUR_ASSIGNMENTS]

   See example section below

5) Uncompress tarball you've downloaded like this
   gzip -dc paexec-X-Y-Z.tar.gz | tar -xf-

6) cd paexec-X-Y-Z

7) mkcmake

8) mkcmake test
   If this step fails on your system, please let me now.

9) mkcmake install

10) If you also want to install examples/, run the following command

   mkcmake all-examples install-examples

   By default examples/ directory is installed
   to ${DATADIR}/doc/paexec/examples/.
   For changing it, set EGDIR environment variable.

11) If you also want to install README, NEWS, TODO, run the following command

   mkcmake install-doc

   By default do files are installed to ${PREFIX}/share/doc/.
   For changing it, set EGDIR environment variable.

12) paexec project consists of the following subprojects: paexec
   (paexec and paexec_reorder executables and appropriate manual
   pages), doc (README etc.), examples (examples of use).  By default
   only "paexec" is built and installed. You can build and install
   other subprojects like the following.

   env SUBPRJ_DFLT='paexec examples doc' mkcmake all install

13)
   paexec_reorder utility is written in RunAWK, so we'll need RunAWK at runtime.

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/runawk/

There is a lot of Makefile variables that can be changed during
build and installation.

  PREFIX         - where paexec paexec_reorder is installed to
  MANDIR         - root directory for manual pages
  DESTDIR        - fake root for installation
  CPPFLAGS
  CFLAGS
  LDFLAGS
  LDADD
  ...

  See mk-configure(7) for details.

------------------------------
Examples of build and installing:

 1)  export PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc MANDIR=/usr/share/man
     mkcmake all
     env DESTDIR=/tmp/fake-root mkcmake install

 2)  export PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc
     mkcmake all examples
     env DESTDIR=/tmp/fake-root mkcmake install install-examples

 3)  env CC='icc' \
       PREFIX=/home/cheusov/local \
       CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/pkg/include' \
       LDFLAGS='-L/usr/pkg/lib -R/usr/pkg/lib' \
       LDADD=-lnbcompat \
          mkcmake -s all install

 4) paexec uses getopt_long(3) for handling long options. On some
     systems it is not available. On such platforms paexec will
     support only short options.
