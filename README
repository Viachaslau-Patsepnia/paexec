                             INSTALLATION

0)
   Maybe paexec is already packaged for your platform. See PACKAGES
   section below and your system's packages management tools.

1)
   We need bmake (portable version of NetBSD make) for building paexec.
   I'd recommend to use latest stable version.

   http://crufty.net/help/sjg/bmake.html
   http://freshmeat.net/projects/bmake/

   NOTE:    !!! GNU make IS NOT GOOD !!!

2)
   We also need mk-configure >= 0.20.0.

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/mk-configure/

3)
   "libmaa" library is also needed. It is a part of
   "dict" project available here:

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/dict/

4)
   If you want to change the default building options,
   run mkcmake like this

     env [YOUR_ASSIGNMENTS] mkcmake <target>

   See example section below

5) Uncompress tarball you've downloaded like this
   gzip -dc paexec-X-Y-Z.tar.gz | tar -xf-

6) cd paexec-X-Y-Z

7) mkcmake

8) mkcmake test
   If this step fails on your system, PLEASE LET ME NOW.

9) mkcmake install

10)
   paexec_reorder utility is written in RunAWK, so we'll need RunAWK at runtime.

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/runawk/

There is a lot of Makefile variables that can be changed during
build and installation.

  PREFIX         - where paexec paexec_reorder is installed to
  MANDIR         - root directory for manual pages
  DESTDIR        - fake root for installation
  CPPFLAGS
  CFLAGS
  LDFLAGS
  LDADD
  ...

  See mk-configure(7) for details.

------------------------------
Examples of build and installing:

 1)  env PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=/tmp/fake-root mkcmake all install

 2)  env CC='icc -no-gcc' \
       PREFIX=/home/cheusov/local \
       CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/pkg/include' \
       LDFLAGS='-L/usr/pkg/lib -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/pkg/lib' \
       LDADD=-lnbcompat \
          mkcmake -s all install

 3) paexec uses getopt_long(3) for handling long options. On some
     systems it is not available. On such platforms paexec will
     support only short options.
