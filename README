paexec: Small program that processes a list of tasks in parallel
        on different CPUs, computers in a network or whatever else.
        Full documentation is available in paexec.1 manual page
        and paexec.html

                             INSTALLATION

0) BSD make is required. I name it 'bmake' but its real name may
   vary.  pmake or just make are possible variants.

   If you need to change the default building options,
   run bmake like this

     env [YOUR_ASSIGNMENTS] bmake <target>

   See example section below

1) "libmaa" library is required to build paexec. It is a part of
   "dict" project http://sourceforge.net/projects/dict

   Quick sample of building:

       gzip -dc /home/cheusov/downloads/dictd-X.Y.Z.tar.gz  | tar -xf-
       cd dictd-X-Y-Z/libmaa
       ./configure
       gmake
       gmake install

   NOTE: gmake is GNU make here! Under most Linux distros
   it is named make.

2) Uncompress paexec tarball you've downloaded like this
   gzip -dc paexec-X-Y-Z.tar.gz | tar -xf-

3) cd paexec-X-Y-Z

4) bmake

5) bmake test
   If this stage fails on your system, PLEASE LET ME NOW.

6) (optional!) bmake install-dirs

7) bmake install

There are a lot of Makefile variables that can be changed during
building and installation.
paexec's own variables (All they are in the begining of Makefile):

  PREFIX         - where paexec is installed to
  LIBMAA         - linker option for linking "maa" library

BSD make's variables (most commonly used,
for all others - see make's documentation and .mk files)

 BINDIR - where paexec executable itself is installed to
 MANDIR - where manual pages are installed to

 BINOWN - paexec executable owner
 BINGRP - paexec executable group

 MANOWN - man page owner
 MANGRP - man page group

Examples of building and installing:

 1)  bmake all install-dirs install

 2)  env CC=icc \
       PREFIX=/home/cheusov/local \
       CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/pkg/include' \
       LDFLAGS='-L/usr/pkg/lib -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/pkg/lib' \
       LDADD=-lextralib \
       CFLAGS='-Werror -Wall' \
       BINOWN=cheusov \
       BINGRP=users \
       MANOWN=cheusov \
       MANGRP=users \
       MKCATPAGES=no \
          bmake -s all install-dirs install

 3)  paexec needs the non-portable getopt_long(3) present in
     *BSD and Linux OSes. If it is absent in your OS,
     you can build paexec like the following.

     echo '#include <getopt.h>' > ./config.h

     env \
       CPPFLAGS='-DNO_PORTABHACKS_H=1 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H=1' \
       LDFLAGS='-lnbcompat' \
          bmake -s all install-dirs install

     where libnbcompat is a NetBSD's portability library

     Of course, you can also use any other implementation of getopt_long.

     NOTE: No, I'll not use autotools
