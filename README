        on different CPUs, computers in a network or whatever else.

                             INSTALLATION

0) BSD make is required. I name it just 'make' but its real name may
   vary.  bmake and pmake are possible names.

   If you need to change the default building options,
   run make like this

     env [YOUR_ASSIGNMENTS] make <target>

   See example section below

1) "libmaa" library is required to build paexec. It is a part of
   "dict" project http://sourceforge.net/projects/dict

   Quick samle of building:

       gzip -dc /home/cheusov/downloads/dictd-X.Y.Z.tar.gz  | tar -xf-
       cd dictd/libmaa
       ./configure
       make
       make install

2) Uncompress paexec tarball you've downloaded like this
   gzip -dc paexec-X-Y-Z.tar.gz | tar -xf-

3) cd paexec-X-Y-Z

4) make

5) (optional!) make install-dirs

6) make install

There are a lot of Makefile variables that can be changed during
building and installation.
paexec's own variables (All they are at the begining of Makefile):

  PREFIX         - where paexec is installed to
  LIBMAA         - linker option for linking "maa" library

BSD make's variables (most commonly used,
for all others - see make's documentation and .mk files)

 BINDIR - where paexec executable itself is installed to
 MANDIR - where manual pages are installed to

 BINOWN - paexec executable owner
 BINGRP - paexec executable group

 MANOWN - man page owner
 MANGRP - man page group

Example of building and installing:
   env CC=gcc \
       PREFIX=/home/cheusov/local \
       CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/pkg/include' \
       LDFLAGS='-L/usr/pkg/lib' \
       LDADD=-lextralib \
       CFLAGS='-Werror -Wall' \
       BINOWN=cheusov \
       BINGRP=users \
       MANOWN=cheusov \
       MANGRP=users \
       MKCATPAGES=no \
          make -s all install-dirs install
