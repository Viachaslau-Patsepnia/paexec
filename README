paexec: Small program that processes a list of tasks in parallel
        on different CPUs, computers in a network or whatever else.
        Full documentation is available in paexec.1 manual page
        and paexec.html

                             INSTALLATION

0) Maybe paexec is already packaged for you platform. See PACKAGES
   section below and your system's package management tools.

1) BSD make is required. I name it 'bmake' but its real name may
   vary.  pmake or just make are possible names on some platforms.

             !!! GNU make IS NOT GOOD !!!

   If you need to change the default building options,
   run bmake like this

     env [YOUR_ASSIGNMENTS] bmake <target>

   See example section below

2) "libmaa" library is required to build paexec. It is a part of
   "dict" project http://sourceforge.net/projects/dict

   Quick sample of building:

       gzip -dc /home/cheusov/downloads/dictd-X.Y.Z.tar.gz  | tar -xf-
       cd dictd-X-Y-Z/libmaa
       ./configure
       gmake
       gmake install

   NOTE: gmake is GNU make here! On most Linux distros
   it is named make.

3) Uncompress paexec tarball you've downloaded like this
   gzip -dc paexec-X-Y-Z.tar.gz | tar -xf-

4) cd paexec-X-Y-Z

5) bmake

6) bmake test
   If this stage fails on your system, PLEASE LET ME NOW.

7) (optional!) bmake installdirs

8) bmake install

There are a lot of Makefile variables that can be changed during
building and installation.
paexec's own variables (All they are in the begining of Makefile):

  PREFIX         - where paexec is installed to
  LIBMAA         - linker option for linking "maa" library

BSD make's variables (most commonly used,
for all others - see make's documentation and .mk files)

 BINDIR - where paexec executable itself is installed to
 MANDIR - where manual pages are installed to

 BINOWN - paexec executable owner
 BINGRP - paexec executable group

 MANOWN - man page owner
 MANGRP - man page group

------------------------------
Examples of building and installing:

 1)  bmake all install-dirs install

 2)  env CC=icc \
       PREFIX=/home/cheusov/local \
       CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/pkg/include' \
       LDFLAGS='-L/usr/pkg/lib -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/pkg/lib' \
       LDADD=-lextralib \
       CFLAGS='-Werror -Wall' \
       BINOWN=cheusov \
       BINGRP=users \
       MANOWN=cheusov \
       MANGRP=users \
       MKCATPAGES=no \
          bmake -s all install-dirs install

 3)  paexec uses the non-portable getopt_long(3) present in *BSD and
     Linux OSes. On other systems (Solaris, HP-UX, Interix etc.)
     paexec will be build without support for long options by default.

     But you still can support them like the following

     echo '[your declarations are here]' > ./config.h

     env \
       CPPFLAGS='-DNO_PORTABHACKS_H=1 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H=1' \
       LDFLAGS='-lgetopt_long' \
          bmake -s all install-dirs install

     For example, NetBSD's portability library (libnbcompat) may be
     used for this.

     NOTE: No, I'll not use autotools

                           PACKAGES

  1) NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD, Linux, Solaris, ... (pkgsrc)

    PAEXEC is packaged in pkgsrc as wip/paexec.

  2) FreeBSD

    PAEXEC is packaged in FreeBSD ports as devel/paexec.

  3) Debian/lenny/x86

    Add the following lines

        deb     http://mova.org/~cheusov/pub/debian       lenny    main
        deb-src http://mova.org/~cheusov/pub/debian       lenny    main

    to /etc/apt/sources.list and then using apt or aptitude commands.
    Binary packages are available only for Debian/Lenny/i386.
    Ubuntu users need to recompile the package for their system.
