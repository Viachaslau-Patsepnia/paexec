                             INSTALLATION

0) BSD make is required. I name it just 'make' but its real name may
   vary.  bmake and pmake are possible names.

   If you need to change the default building options,
   run make like this

     env [YOUR_ASSIGNMENTS] make <target>

   See example section below

1) Uncompress tarball you've downloaded like this
   gzip -dc paexec-X-Y-Z.tar.gz | tar -xf-

2) cd paexec-X-Y-Z

3) make

4) (optional!) make install-dirs

5) make install

There are a lot of Makefile variables that can be changed during
installation.  paexec's own variables (All they are at the begining of
Makefile):

 PREFIX         - where paexec is installed to
 LIBMAA         - linker option for linking "maa" library

BSD make's variables (most commonly used,
for all others - see make's documentation and .mk files)

 BINDIR - where paexec executable itself is installed to
 MANDIR - where manual pages are installed to

 BINOWN - paexec executable owner
 BINGRP - paexec executable group

 MANOWN - man page owner
 MANGRP - man page group

Example:
   env CC=gcc \
       PREFIX=/home/cheusov/local \
       LDFLAGS='-L/usr/pkg/lib -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/pkg/lib' \
       LDADD=-lextralib \
       CFLAGS='-Werror -Wall' \
       CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/pkg/include \
       BINOWN=cheusov \
       BINGRP=users \
       MANOWN=cheusov \
       MANGRP=users \
       MKCATPAGES=no \
          make -s all install-dirs install
