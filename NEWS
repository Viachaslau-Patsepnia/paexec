Version 0.9.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 15 Jun 2008 10:23:52 +0300

   -t '' means "no transport". This significantly simplifies writing
   shell scripts with paexec. Added: tests for this case.

   paexec has no limited internal buffers anymore. All they are
   resized automatically as it is needed. PAEXEC_BUFSIZE environment
   variable sets an *initial* buffer size, not *maximum* one.

   README: note about non-standard function getopt_long, and advice
   how to build paexec on platforms with no getopt_long support
   (HP-UX, Solaris etc.).

   More regressions tests

   paexec.1: minor corrections.

   'make test' fix: In case regression test fails, 'make test' exits
   with non-zero exit status.

   paexec can be built with ancient version pmake-1.45 (found in som
   Linux distributions).

   paexec -h|--help outputs messages to stderr - my new religion :-)
