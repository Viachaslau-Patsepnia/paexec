Version 0.10.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 31 Aug 2008 21:37:59 +0300

   Lots of new regression tests

   README file: 'make test' is documented

   ADDED: -s option
       Partially ordered set of tasks are read from stdin.

       Instead of autonomous tasks, graph of the tasks is read from
       stdin.  In this mode every task can either FAIL or SUCCEED.  As
       always an empty line output by command means end of task.  The
       line before it shows an EXIT STATUS of the task.  The word
       "failure" means failure, "success" - success.
       See examples/1_div_x/1_div_X_cmd for the sample.  An input line
       (paexec's stdin) should contain either single task without
       spaces inside or two tasks separated by single space character,
       e.g.  task1<SPC>task2. task1<SPC>task2 line means that task1
       must be done before task2 and it is mandatory, that is if task1
       fail all dependent tasks (including task2) are also failed
       recursively.  Tasks having dependencies are started only after
       all dependencies are succeeded. When a task succeeds paexec
       outputs "success" word just before end_of_task marker (see -e
       or -E), otherwise "failure" word is output followed by a list
       of tasks failed because of it.

              Samples:

                tasks (examples/make_package/make_package_tasks file)

                  textproc/dictem

                command (examples/make_package/make_package_cmd__flex)

                  #!/usr/bin/awk -f
                  {
                     print $0 # print a package name

                     if ($0 == "devel/flex")
                        print "failure" # cannot build flex ;-)
                     else
                        print "success" # all other packages are ok

                     print ""       # end of task marker
                     fflush()
                  }

                output of "paexec -s -l -c make_package_cmd__flex -n +10 \
                           < make_package_tasks"

                  3 devel/autoconf
                  3 success
                  4 devel/gmake
                  4 success

                  9 failure

Version 0.9.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 15 Jun 2008 10:23:52 +0300

   -t '' means "no transport". This significantly simplifies writing
   shell scripts with paexec. Added: tests for this case.

   paexec has no limited internal buffers anymore. All they are
   resized automatically as it is needed. PAEXEC_BUFSIZE environment
   variable sets an *initial* buffer size, not *maximum* one.

   README: note about non-standard function getopt_long, and advice
   how to build paexec on platforms with no getopt_long support
   (HP-UX, Solaris etc.).

   More regressions tests

   paexec.1: minor corrections.

   'make test' fix: In case regression test fails, 'make test' exits
   with non-zero exit status.

   paexec can be built with ancient version pmake-1.45 (found in som
   Linux distributions).

   paexec -h|--help outputs messages to stderr - my new religion :-)

======================================================================
Version 0.8.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Tue,  4 Mar 2008 00:32:56 +0200

   New options implemented: -E, -i and -I
   See manual page for details.

   Fixes and minor improvements in the documentation

======================================================================
Version 0.7.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Tue, 26 Feb 2008 23:57:15 +0200

   new -e|--eot option implemented.
   It prints the end-of-task marker (an empty line) to stdout.
   See manual page.

   WARNS=4 to see compilation warnings.
   several gcc warnings fixed.

   fixed: '-n +0' and '-n ""' now fails with error message.

   minor fix in man page

   minor clean-ups
