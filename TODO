Currently if error happens while talking to slave host/CPU, paexec
exits with error immediately. That is an error of read(2) and
write(2) operations are fatal. This may happen if slave host's OS
hangs up, command-program segfaults, connection is lost etc.
  TODO:
    1) if such bad things happen paexec shell mark appropriate tasks
       "needs to be rerun" and resend them to another slave host/CPU
    2) rerun failed command on "bad" host after timeout

tasks as a "partially ordered set" of tasks. Each task may fail or
succeed. Failure of the task shell mark all dependent tasks as failed.

non-blocking write(2) for sending task to slave hosts/CPUs.

avoid using read(0, BUF, 1) # 1 -> <NUM> is needed

command for resorting output of "paexec -l"
